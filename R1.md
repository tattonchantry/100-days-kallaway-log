## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: June 28. Friday

**Today's Progress**:
1) Tried to figure out GitHub.
2) Worked on opening the gmet topo files for Nicolas.

**Thoughts:** I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 2: June 29. Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
Started to code an array of Brownian Walk with 100 time steps and
1000 realizations.

**Thoughts:** Read a lot about Bownian walk.  It is a very significant thing
to understand in datascience, and in my thesis.  Though I understand the
concept and the math, I could not code it quickly and efficiently.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 2: June 30. Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
Finished Brownian Walk with 100 time steps and 1000 realizations.

**Thoughts:** I banged my head against this for hours yesterday with no
progress, sometimes it's useful to step away for a day, because I got what I
wanted within minutes of looking at it today.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 2: July 1. Monday

**Today's Progress**:
Read some more about stochastic processes, integrating, derivating(sp?) along
Brownian Walk.

My son wanted to program a circle and a yellow triangle, so I used my
programming time today to plot up those things with him.

**Thoughts:** It's great to involve the kids.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.
