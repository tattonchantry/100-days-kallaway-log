## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: June 28. Friday

**Today's Progress**:
1) Tried to figure out GitHub.
2) Worked on opening the gmet topo files for Nicolas.

**Thoughts:** I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 2: June 29. Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
Started to code an array of Brownian Walk with 100 time steps and
1000 realizations.

**Thoughts:** Read a lot about Bownian walk.  It is a very significant thing
to understand in datascience, and in my thesis.  Though I understand the
concept and the math, I could not code it quickly and efficiently.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 2: June 30. Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
Finished Brownian Walk with 100 time steps and 1000 realizations.

**Thoughts:** I banged my head against this for hours yesterday with no
progress, sometimes it's useful to step away for a day, because I got what I
wanted within minutes of looking at it today.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 2: July 1. Monday

**Today's Progress**:
Read some more about stochastic processes, integrating, derivating(sp?) along
Brownian Walk.

My son wanted to program a circle and a yellow triangle, so I used my
programming time today to plot up those things with him.

**Thoughts:** It's great to involve the kids.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 3: July 2. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
Worked hard to get set up on the Highh Powered Computers (HPC) at NPS.

**Thoughts:** No work to show, but I learned a lot about VPNs and Jupyter
servers

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 4: July 3. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
I went to the school and did some work on the GPU.  I got the GPU to run
tensorflow smoothly on a script from Github, but was unable to get my own
working because I had a problem in the json.

I also finished 6 problems on hackerrank.com

**Thoughts:** I wish I had money for a GPU.  Google colab looks cool, but costs
too much.  AWS is awesome, I have it set up, but never pulled the trigger for
fear of how much the computing might cost.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 4: July 4. Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
I did another 2 problems on hackerrank.com and started the huarongdao problem.

**Thoughts:** Happy 4th!  And...  Uh... huarongdao is going to be a PROBLEM!!

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.
