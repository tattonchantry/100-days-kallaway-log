## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: June 28. Friday

**Today's Progress**:
1) Tried to figure out GitHub.
2) Worked on opening the gmet topo files for Nicolas.

**Thoughts:** I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 2: June 29. Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
Started to code an array of Brownian Walk with 100 time steps and
1000 realizations.

**Thoughts:** Read a lot about Bownian walk.  It is a very significant thing
to understand in datascience, and in my thesis.  Though I understand the
concept and the math, I could not code it quickly and efficiently.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 3: June 30. Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
Finished Brownian Walk with 100 time steps and 1000 realizations.

**Thoughts:** I banged my head against this for hours yesterday with no
progress, sometimes it's useful to step away for a day, because I got what I
wanted within minutes of looking at it today.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 4: July 1. Monday

**Today's Progress**:
Read some more about stochastic processes, integrating, derivating(sp?) along
Brownian Walk.

My son wanted to program a circle and a yellow triangle, so I used my
programming time today to plot up those things with him.

**Thoughts:** It's great to involve the kids.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 5: July 2. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
Worked hard to get set up on the Highh Powered Computers (HPC) at NPS.

**Thoughts:** No work to show, but I learned a lot about VPNs and Jupyter
servers

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 6: July 3. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
I went to the school and did some work on the GPU.  I got the GPU to run
tensorflow smoothly on a script from Github, but was unable to get my own
working because I had a problem in the json.

I also finished 6 problems on hackerrank.com

**Thoughts:** I wish I had money for a GPU.  Google colab looks cool, but costs
too much.  AWS is awesome, I have it set up, but never pulled the trigger for
fear of how much the computing might cost.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 7: July 4. Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
I did another 2 problems on hackerrank.com and started the huarongdao problem.

**Thoughts:** Happy 4th!  And...  Uh... huarongdao is going to be a PROBLEM!!

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 8: July 5. Friday

**Today's Progress**:
I did another 2 problems on hackerrank.com and worked on the huarongdao
 problem.

**Thoughts:** We are going to Roaring Camp today, and I overslept.  Didn't get
a full hour in.  Hopefully tonight.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.

### Day 9: July 6. Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
I worked on the Huarongdao problem some more.

**Thoughts:** I don't know why hackerrank jumped me from the easiest problems
to an expert problem.  Writing this in python without numoy is just dumb.

I am just realizing that I may have taken on too much with this hundred days
of code.  I have a full schedule this quarter and my thesis is due September 1.
I have only written part of the introduction.  But this Masters will not get
me a job, so I MUST be a datascientist by May!!

### Day 10: July 7. Sunday

**Today's Progress**:
I worked on some random hackerrank problems to warm up, then worked on Thesis
writing.

Later in the day wrote
[slopes](https://github.com/tattonchantry/100-days-kallaway-log/blob/my_branch/scripts/slopes.py)
to help my wife with some homework on lines.

**Thoughts:** I need to be programming in my thesis stuff right now, but I
am a bit burnt out on it.  Thankful that I came across this 100 days, and
hackerrank to give me something to keep me fresh and interested.

### Day 11: July 8. Monday

**Today's Progress**:
Summer quarter begins...  I worked on my masks and getting the model running
on the HPC.

**Thoughts:** I need to be writing Thesis not code.  I don't know why I started
this, but I also don't want to give up.

### Day 12: July 9. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
It took a lot of programming to get the big overview figure for my thesis. But,
I think I got a beautiful picture.

**Thoughts:** Got a little Thesis writing done, and got the overview figure in
place.

### Day 13: July 10. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**:
Did a whole lot of programming trying to fix a problem within the ML part of
the Thesis.

Also wrote a small script to make a yellow triangle for Brogan Wells.
(Just put his whole name there to see if my google alert will pick up on it).

**Thoughts:** Why oh why do all the pictures have different orientations
according to how they are opened in python?  It has to have something to do
with some flag that the camera put in.  Most were 2008x3008, but some flipped
to 3008x2008 if they were opened with PIL or opencv.  Unfortunately for me,
the training code I am using uses both opencv and skimage in different parts
of the code.  It took weeks to figure out what the problem was and all day
yesterday to find a solution.  It turns out, I just have to use skimage to
read in the problem image, and resave with skimage.  Then all three modules
read it the same.

Now, do I want to make a for loop do that to all the images (600,000)?  Or,
was the problem only with the images I did masks for, and it will not affect
tensorflow? I don't know what the underlying problem is, so I guess I better
fix them.

### Day 14: July 11. Thursday

**Today's Progress**:
Fixed all the images.  Also, put some time into the HPC model for my tropical
class.

**Thoughts:** I really need to start pumping out some Jupyter notebooks for
Co.  She is ready to start working on the same type of data, and I need to make
it easy for her.  I also want to put all the remote sensing labs into Jupyter
notebook format for my prof.  He said to only do it if I didn't have anything
else to do (LOL), but I would like to do that for him.

### Day 19: July 16. Tuesday

**Today's Progress**:
Wrote the lab for Numerical.

**Thoughts:** I didn't write on here for a few days, but I definitely
programmed a lot every day.  I got some code ready for Co to take to Florida
and read aircraft data as it comes of the plane.  I also did some more work on
the tensorflow model.

### Day 23: July 20. Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
Again I forgot to log it here, but I did a lot of programming.  I got a usable
program for Co to take to Florida.  I think she will be able to impress some
people with it.  She can make some 3d models of the flights as soon as they
get the data off.

**Thoughts:** I am going to start on this
[book](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html) from
greenteapress.com.  I think the simple exercises will keep me logging here.

I really need to get focused on thesis though.  My current problem is how to
determine stability from the aircraft data.

### Day 24: July 21. Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I worked on the ThinkPython book some more.  I am way too far past Chapter One
but I did the examples anyway.  It wanted to use the interpreter as a
calculator, but I defined some functions and got user input, just because I
could and I finally mastered the .format crap that I couldn't figure out.

**Thoughts:**
* I should move this whole log into a Jupyter Notebook
* I want to get
[these interactive tables](https://towardsdatascience.com/interactive-visualizations-in-jupyter-notebook-3be02ab2b8cd)
to work in Jupyter Notebook.

### Day 25-44: July 31. Sunday

**Today's Progress**
I have been programming at least 2 hours per day, but not recording progress
here.  I really need to get about that. I got some spectogram figures done
for Andy's reasearch.  That was a lot of time spent not working on my own
thesis, but I learned a lot about different ways to plot timeseries.

**Thoughts:**
[librosa](https://librosa.github.io/librosa/index.html) has some amazing
tutorials!!
