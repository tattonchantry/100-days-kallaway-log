### Day 2: June 29. Saturday

**Today's Progress**:
Started to code an array of Brownian Walk with 100 time steps and
1000 realizations.

**Thoughts:** Read a lot about Bownian walk.  It is a very significant thing
to understand in datascience, and in my thesis.  Though I understand the
concept and the math, I could not code it quickly and efficiently.

I am going to be a DataScientist by May.
